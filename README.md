# Secret_Santa
This is an application to randomly assign everybody a secret santa and allow them to add their wishlists.

## Targets
I am trying to write a program for secret santa
I want the program to be able to do some certain things like:

1.	Be able to input the names of all the people who will be involved in the secret santa
2.	Be able to set parameters on who can be able to gift who and who can't gift who
3.	Be able to decide how many individuals a secret santa will be able to gift
4.	Individuals involved in the secret santa should also be able to make a wish list and update it at will
5.	There should also be some anonymity as no one should be able to see who is their secret santa
6.	Secret santa should be able to view the wish list of whoever they are gifting 
7.	The parameters should be able to be set by the user as well
8.  It should be connected to a an API
9.  It should also be a web application that is updated in real time
